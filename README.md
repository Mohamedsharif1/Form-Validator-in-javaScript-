# Form Validator in JavaScript

## Introduction
Welcome to my Form Validator project! This project was initially created in 2019, but I am uploading it now to share one of my earliest works in JavaScript. As one of my first basic projects, it represents the beginning of my journey into web development and programming.

## Project Description
This project includes a simple form validation functionality using JavaScript. It demonstrates my early understanding of the language and covers essential JavaScript concepts such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Regular Expressions
- Basic DOM Manipulation

### Features
- Validates user input for form fields
- Provides real-time feedback to users
- Ensures required fields are not empty
- Checks for valid email format
- Validates password strength and match.
